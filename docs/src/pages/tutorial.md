[@reatom/core](/packages/core) is already powerful solution for many cases and you could use it as it is for building micro libraries or whole applications. But regular development is included a lot of same hight level patterns, which every developer reimplementing by self or by using external libraries. It hard to archive perfect interaction between all this utils in terms of: interfaces equality and semantics compatibility, ACID, debugging and logging experience. Because of that [@reatom/framework](https://www.reatom.dev/packages/framework) and other packages building in the monorepo of Reatom.

```sh
npm i @reatom/framework
```

> Also, we have a [package for testing](https://www.reatom.dev/packages/testing)!
