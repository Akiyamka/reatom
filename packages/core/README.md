## What is state management?

`State` is a term from [FSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) thats mean a consistent data with predicted shape (and literals) in some time slice of application lifetime.

State manager provides an API for describe and transform application state in a right way, you may solve a most class of problems with it, management domain data (user profile, entities editing...) or environment data (routing, network cache...).

Those problem you may solve by other ways too: streams / services / classes, but if you want more reliability guaranties and better debugging experience state manager do it best.

## Guides

### Introduction

The main item of Reatom core is `createAtom`. It is a pack of most needed features which help you to solve most tasks. Generally, architecture of Reatom build around a store, which an event emitter with two queues: pure computations and side effect. Atoms allow you to describe reactive computations with fine granted optimizations and schedule effects.

> If you need \ interesting in detailed architecture design you should check [architecture chapter](#Internal-architecture) and [next chapter](#Write-you-own-atom-creator) about building your own atom creators.

As any computations, it results and effects processed by a store, it easy for debugging and testing. But not every application need it and for that case we have a `defaultStore` which bind to createAtom and allow to subscribe to it and dispatch it actions _inline_ without manual store management.

#### Basic example

`createAtom` accept two required arguments: a collection of dependencies and reducer function. Third argument is optional and allow you to set atom indeteficator or reducer decorators.

```ts
import { createAtom } from '@reatom/core'

const inputAtom = createAtom(
  // Plain function in dependencies converting to action creators,
  // which you may handle in the reducer
  { change: (text: string) => text },
  // Reducer is a function which recall on every related dispatch.
  // The `track` parameter includes handlers
  // to subscribe and react to dependencies actions and atoms
  (track, state = ``) => {
    track.onAction(`change`, (text) => (state = text))
    return state
  },
)

const greetingAtom = createAtom(
  // Atoms in dependencies available in the reducer
  // to receiving it state and subscribe to they changes
  { input: inputAtom },
  (track) => `Hello, ${track.get(`input`)}!`,
)

// calculate actual state
greetingAtom.getState()
// -> `Hello, !`

// Get described (in the first argument) action creator
// from static property by the same name
inputAtom.change(`Tom`)
// { type: `atom [1] - change`, payload: `Tom` }

// Instead of action creation, dispatch it to the `defaultStore`
// Similar as `defaultStore.dispatch(inputAtom.change(`Tom`))`
inputAtom.change.dispatch(`Tom`)
// Action creators from `createAtom` includes it owner atom
// and always processed by it
greetingAtom.getState()
// -> `Hello, Tom!`

// Equal to `defaultStore.subscribe(greetingAtom, () => ...)`
greetingAtom.subscribe((greeting) => console.log(greeting))
// -> `Hello, Tom!`

inputAtom.change.dispatch(`Tom`)
// Nothing happen coz the state is not changed

inputAtom.change.dispatch(`Bob`)
// -> `Hello, Bob!`
```

As you may see, Reatom flow looks like Redux flow, but reducers and selectors is unified to atoms, which allows you to describe data receiving naturally, as in MobX. Also, atoms have an API for handling side-effects declarative, but flexible, see below.

Example above is a basic and don't show all cool features of Reatom. See [API section](#API) or [Guides](#Guides) to learn more about how to solve your tasks fast and efficient.

#### Timer example

[![codesandbox with timerAtom example](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/timeratom-example-vdtc0)

```ts
import { createAtom } from '@reatom/core'

type TimerCtx = { intervalId?: number | NodeJS.Timer | any }

/** Timer update interval */
export const intervalAtom = createAtom(
  { setSeconds: (seconds: number) => seconds },
  ({ onAction }, state = 1000) => {
    onAction(`setSeconds`, (seconds) => (state = seconds * 1000))
    return state
  },
)

export const timerAtom = createAtom(
  {
    interval: intervalAtom,
    start: (delayInSeconds: number) => delayInSeconds,
    stop: () => null,
    // Action mappers which name starts with underscore
    // is not allowed as action creators by atom static properties
    // and may be used only as part of internal logic
    _update: (remains: number) => remains,
  },
  ({ create, get, onAction, onChange, schedule }, state = 0) => {
    const interval = get(`interval`)

    function start(delay: number) {
      const start = Date.now()

      schedule((dispatch, ctx: TimerCtx) => {
        clearInterval(ctx.intervalId)

        ctx.intervalId = setInterval(() => {
          const passed = Date.now() - start
          const remains = delay - passed

          if (remains <= interval) {
            clearInterval(ctx.intervalId)
            ctx.intervalId = setTimeout(
              () => dispatch(create(`_update`, 0)),
              remains,
            )
          }

          dispatch(create(`_update`, remains))
        }, interval)
      })
    }

    onAction(`stop`, () => {
      state = 0

      schedule((dispatch, ctx: TimerCtx) => clearInterval(ctx.intervalId))
    })

    onAction(`start`, (delaysInSeconds) => start(delaysInSeconds * 1000))

    onChange(`interval`, () => {
      if (state !== 0) start(state)
    })

    onAction(`_update`, (remains) => (state = remains))

    return state
  },
)
```

#### Async resource example

[![codesandbox with createResource example](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/reatom-createresource-k00fq)

#### Primitives

Primitives is a pack of helpers around primitive data structures, which helps you reduce boilerplate. It not included in `2kb` main bundle, but tiny by it selfs and do not includes into your application bundle if you not importing it.

> Available primitives: `createBooleanAtom`, `createMapAtom`, `createNumberAtom`, `createStringAtom`, `createSetAtom` (`crateArrayAtom` will added soon).

```ts
import { createBooleanAtom } from '@reatom/core/primitives'

export const isModelOpenAtom = createBooleanAtom(false, 'isModelOpen')

// Available action creators:
isModelOpenAtom.toggle()
// -> { payload: null, type: 'isModelOpen - toggle' }
isModelOpenAtom.setTrue()
// -> { payload: null, type: 'isModelOpen - setTrue' }
isModelOpenAtom.setFalse()
// -> { payload: null, type: 'isModelOpen - setFalse' }
isModelOpenAtom.change((state) => !state)
// -> { payload: Function, type: 'isModelOpen - change' }
```

A string atom is useful to describe an enum.

```ts
import { createStringAtom } from '@reatom/core/primitives'

export type Statuses = 'init' | 'loading' | 'loaded' | 'error'

export const statusAtom = createStringAtom<Statuses>('init')
```

### Increase performance by ref pattern

> This is an ADVANCED pattern! We do not recommend to use it in regular development as it add extra complexity.

If you fill limits of immutable data structures and need to increase performance of partial updates of a huge lists / collections you may use _ref pattern_ and wrap every element of collection in an atom. With this you may change the atom value and it will not affect a collection reference. But when you will need to get plain data / JSON of collection you should unwrap every element from atoms as write you own serialize.

### Write you own atom creator

`createAtom` is a main public API you need to describe simple and complex logic of your application, it already includes a few features and optimizations which enough for most programming tasks. Anyway in a rare cases of regular development or if you a library / package author you may need a low level API to build something more flexible or complex. Fortunately we spend a lot of time for improvements of Reatom basic API and made it simple, but powerful.

An atom it a simple reducer like function which accept a transaction context and optional cache object with state data and a few meta fields and return new immutable version of the cache.

```ts
export type Atom<State = any> = {
  (transaction: Transaction, cache?: CacheTemplate<State>): Cache<State>
  id: string
  types: Array<Action['type']>
}
```

Atom should have **unique** field `id` for it identification (helps with debug and tooling). Also atom should have field `types` with a list of all dependency types which need to optimize dispatch behavior and archive granular updates in a single global store.

Transaction is a context witch includes list of actions and two functions: `process` (call and memoize dependency atom) and `schedule` (schedule effect to the en of success atom computations).

Cache is a immutable data of an atom which includes state, actual dependencies and other meta (check typings).

### Single global store

When state managers come to web development it improves an application architecture and debugging, one-directional dataflow is more obvious and predictable. But race conditions, cyclic dependencies and glitches were shoots a legs still sometimes. Redux was fix it by immutable data (with DAG limitations) and single global store, but comes with performance limitations. Reatom try to improve redux and make a little step forward in state management generally. Basically, Reatom is two queues event emitter with actions instead of events.

### Action VS Event

One of the biggest feature and goal of the Reatom is [atomicity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomicity_(database_systems)>) guarantees for processed state (from atoms). It is achieved by separating calculations for two consecutive stages: pure computations and side-effects. If first stage (pure computations) throws an error, accumulated patch from touched atoms will be ignored, state will be not changed and the second stage (side-effects calls) will be not processed. It is the difference between events and actions: event is statement of happened fact, but action is intentions to do something (change state) so we may react to it only after it (state changing) happen.

### Actions tracking and normalization

Each atom have a list of all dependencies action types which used to match a dispatch and related atoms. As we focus only on types which is leafs of atoms graph we do not need for bidirectional atoms links what give to us unidirectional graph of atoms relationship which totally immutable and friendly to some processing and debug.

### Lazy branches

In `createAtom` you may use native language mechanic for branching you data flow: `if`/`else` statement or ternary operator right in place of your reactive data receiving (a `get` function), Reatom do smart dynamical tracking of all dependencies and subscribe / unsubscribe only for needed.

## Goals

### Experiments

We want to grow a huge ecosystem around Reatom and make it qualitative. We are welcome for PRs with new utilities, not meter how huge or small it is, but the good way to test the API and stability of the new package is trying it in a _demo_ mode first. For thats purposes and for prevent holding an name of subpackage by unfinished utilities we recommends to add an new utilities in `experiments` folder of the domain package. Feel free to make breaking changes in this code, but try to finish your experiment faster and publish it as a subpackage.

This approach increase domain package size in `node_modules` whe you install it, but 100% treeshakable so it looks a good way.

## FAQ

### How to handle one action in a few atoms?

Probably you should not to do this, try to use (batch)[#Batch] instead.

```ts
const handleSubmit = () => {
  return [formAtom.clear(), routerAtom.go('/')]
}
// ...
dispatch(handleSubmit())
```

### Why Store have no `getState` method, similar to Redux?

Each Store have own WeakMap to store atoms cache. WeakMap have no API to iterate over stored data and we just can not read it. We can iterate and read data from atoms with active listeners, but it may be not enough and result may be unpredictable in a different time of application runtime. Also, in practice, we do not need all state snapshot, only critical parts. So, the better way is wrap each needed atom to something like `persist` helper.
