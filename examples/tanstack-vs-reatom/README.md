## Api setup

You need to generate github developer token to be able to make API calls. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens, click to "Generate new token" ("Generate new token (classic)"), use "octokit" name (it doesn't meter), no need to enable any options (checkboxes). Copy the generated token and put it to `.env` file like that: `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=BHJyG87G_8yg8yVb8YVB9Ubvu1ghvb`
